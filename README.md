# credit-card-fraud-detection
 This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and accurately detect fraudulent activities. 
Project Objective :
Perform in-depth analysis on the dataset to identify potential fraudulent transactions and distinguish them from legitimate ones. Objective 2: Visualize and compare fraudulent and genuine transactions based on various features. Come Implement machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities and evaluate their performance metrics. Objective 4: Handle class imbalances using sampling techniques or class weights to improve model performance. 

Data Set Description: 
The dataset includes transactions made by credit card holders between September 2013 and October 2014. It consists of 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 transactions are marked as fraudulent (0.172%). 

Project Steps: 
Understand and preprocess the dataset, dealing with missing values and outliers. Identify features that differentiate fraudulent and genuine transactions, Data Visualization: 
Visualize fraudulent and genuine transactions across various features. Analyze relationships between different features and fraudulent tendencies. Modiming 
Apply machine learning algorithms to train the dataset. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Perform hyperparameter tuning and overfitting prevention techniques, Fraud Detection and Model Evaluation: 
Test the trained model on real data to assess its ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions. Review and focus on improving the model's performance. Model Update and Enhancement: 
Periodically update the model with new data to create a more resilient model against evolving fraudulent tactics. System Security and Privacy 
Implement appropriate measures to ensure data security and privacy due to the sensitive nature of the data.

Explanations:
Data Preprocessing (üîç): The preprocessing phase involved handling missing values and outliers, which significantly improved the quality of the data, making it more suitable for analysis.

Feature Scaling (üéØ): Applying normalization and standardization techniques to the features resulted in enhanced model performance and better convergence during the training process.

Resampling Techniques (üìä): Using both oversampling and undersampling methods helped in creating a balanced class distribution, preventing the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Model Selection (‚öôÔ∏è): Testing various algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest allowed us to identify the best-performing model that provided the most accurate predictions for fraud detection.

Neural Network Architecture (üß†): The implementation of a deep learning model with multiple layers enabled the system to learn intricate patterns within the data, leading to highly accurate predictions for fraud detection.

Technologies Used:
Python (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) Data Visualization Tools
